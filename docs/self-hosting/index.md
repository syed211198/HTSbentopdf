# Self-Hosting Guide

BentoPDF can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. This guide covers various deployment options.

## Quick Start with Docker

The fastest way to self-host BentoPDF:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:80 ghcr.io/bentopdf/bentopdf:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'
services:
  bentopdf:
    image: ghcr.io/bentopdf/bentopdf:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Building from Source

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/bentopdf/bentopdf.git
cd bentopdf
npm install
npm run build

# The built files are in the `dist` folder
```

## Configuration Options

### Simple Mode

Simple Mode is designed for internal organizational use where you want to hide all branding and marketing content, showing only the essential PDF tools.

**What Simple Mode hides:**
- Navigation bar
- Hero section with marketing content
- Features, FAQ, testimonials sections
- Footer
- Updates page title to "PDF Tools"

```bash
# Build with Simple Mode
SIMPLE_MODE=true npm run build

# Or use the pre-built Docker image
docker run -p 3000:8080 bentopdf/bentopdf-simple:latest
```

See [SIMPLE_MODE.md](https://github.com/bentopdf/bentopdf/blob/main/SIMPLE_MODE.md) for full details.

### Base URL

Deploy to a subdirectory:

```bash
BASE_URL=/pdf-tools/ npm run build
```
